<h2>The Lighthouse</h>
<div>
<p>A still of the upcoming noir film The Lighthouse starring William Dafoe and Robert Pattinson. According to the lead actors, they barely spoke a word to each other during filming due to the exhaustion caused by filming in such miserable weather. Pattinson stayed at a normal hotel with the rest of the filmcrew but Dafoe lived in a little fishing cottage in solitude. - Filmatic</p>

<h4>500 Days Of Summer</h>
<div>
<p>A still from 500 Days of Summer starring Joseph Gordon Levitt and Zooey Deschanel. A lot, if not most of bands featured on the soundtrack, like Simon & Garfunkel, actually broke up. This was done on purpose to mirror the break up of Tom and Summer. - Diply</p>

<h5>Forrest Gump</h>
<div>
<p>A still from classic movie Forrest Gump starring Tom Hanks. The studio was a day away from pulling the plug on the film due to budgeting. Tom Hanks didn’t only split the cost for his iconim running sequence, he also wasn't paid for the role, and instead asked that he take a part of the film's profits (which ended up being a good gamble). - Chron Magazine</p>
